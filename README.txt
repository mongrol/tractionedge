As a former constable in the outlying reaches of Victorian England, you are
recruited to a government organisation to help investigate some odd occurances
in the regions. What you uncover is unlike anything you've seen before. As you
become embroiled in conflict and counterfuge, it seems humanity itself is
on the verge of something far far greater.

Traction Edge is a steampunk turn based strategy game with roguelike elements.
It is similar in gameplay to UFO or Jagged Alliance where during a turn you
move all your units by spending Action Points. All movements and actions,
firing, inventory manipulation costs AP. Once your AP is all used up you end
your turn. The AI then takes it's turn.

Terrain plays an important part in gameplay. There are currently 3 height levels.
Grass, cobbles, dirt etc can be moved over and cost 1 AP. Low walls, fences,
rivers etc cost more to move over but can be "seen" through and you can "shoot"
 through them also. Walls, doors, windows, statues etc cannot be moved through.
Doors currently cannot be opened and must be shot out. Everything is
destructable.
