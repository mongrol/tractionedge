*Map Object*

The map is a fixed size currently 40x30. This should move to a scrollable
window style for larger, flexible map sizes.

Map is a 2d vector on Terrain objects.

*Terrain Object*
* moveCost:     AP cost to move over this tile. This should be a base and can
*               be modded by Creature skills/attribs
* Height:       0 = flat, 1 = 50% waist high, 2 = Full height. Generally you cannot
                pass height 2.
* totalHitPoints:   The terrain's starting HP.
* currentHitPoints: The terrain's current HP.
* deadTerrain:      the gfxId_t of the terrain it should be replaced with when
                    destroyed.
* isPassable:   Is a creature allowed to pass this. Generaly determined by
                height.
* isTranslucent: Can the FOV see through the terrain
* isVisible:     Is it currently in view. As below? The terrain object
                shouldn't care whether it is visible or not. Bad design here.
* wasVisible:   Has it ever been seen before? Used to show the darker areas of
                the map. Ideally the terrain object shouldn't care about this
                and a seperate vector held to contain wasVisible tiles. (better
                design).
