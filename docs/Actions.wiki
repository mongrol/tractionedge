== Actions ==

Actions are performed by the player. Moving, opening doors, spotting, firing,
attacking. Success is determined usually by a combination of the creatures
attributes, the skill involved, the item and any challenging attributes on
opposing objects or creatures.

All actions have an AP cost. Some are fixed, others can be reduced by a skill
or item boost.
