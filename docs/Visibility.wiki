== Visibility ==

Each Creature has a Vision Attribute. This tells us how far the FOV algorithm
will calc visible tiles for.

*Proposed*
When a tile with another factions creature is on it. A roll is made against the
creatures stealth skill to determine whether it has been spotted. If
successful, the creature is drawn on the map and marked visible. (NOT
IMPLEMENTED YET)
