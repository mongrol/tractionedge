== Reaction Fire==

Reaction fire is when the player gets the opportunity to fire during the
enemies turn.

*Current*
When an enemy moves an FOV check is done on all the opposing sides players. If
the enemy is spotted the opposing creature will fire if he has the AP to take a
SNAPSHOT left over from their previous turn.

Since TE movement is tile by tile. A reactive response can occur from multiple
creatures on every step as long as they have AP. I've yet to see another TBS
game with such aggressive reaction fire.

*   Chance of getting a shot off;
    - Dexterity initiative.
        - Determine percentage from DEX difference (target Dex / attacker Dex *
          100 /2 
        - Roll for defense against that percentage.
        - Then roll 51/51?

* Future?
