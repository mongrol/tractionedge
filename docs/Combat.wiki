== Turn Combat ==

=== Ranged ===

Squad member chooses a target tile. A accuracy (tolerance) angle is then calculated by a
number of modifiers. Finally a random angle is chosen within that tolerance and
the project is fired.


*Current Angle Mod*
* First tolerence angle is a definite hit on one block at weapon->range.
* Creatures skill level for selected weapon
    - 1/(skill/100)
* Firing mode (Snap or Aim)
    - Aim = 1
    - Snap = 0.6
* DEX mod=dexterity/20*(100/weapon->weight)*strMod (STR/20)

*New Mods on Angle*
* Creature skill level for selected weapon DONE
* Firing mode DONE
* STR mods how much weapon weight affects the DEX mod. DONE
* DEX modded with weapon weight. DONE.

*Future*
* Have accuracy property on items. Rifles shoot true. Pistol, blunderbusses can
  never be truly accurate.

=== Damage ===

* Damage is increased or decreases based on a base Range attribute.
* TODO: Vary damage by some random amount. +-50%?

=== Melee ===

* Damage is Weapon.damage*strength/10. Meaning a str of 10 your damage would
  equal the weapon damage. Potentially doubling the damage when we hit 20.
* Might put in a random mod at some point although the stats are so course it
  may not be usable.
