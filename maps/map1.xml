Detective Oakshott approaches....
\
\
\"Congratulations Constable. Your staunch upholding of justice
\in the regions has come to the attention of certain courts
\and they have instructed me to fill an recent vacancy in our
\ranks by recruiting a chap of your very calibre.
\
\That said, I am delighted to present you with a place in Her
\Majesty's Bureau of Fairly Unusual Occurances. You may not
\of caught word of this particular department of Her Majesties
\New Police but be assured your familiarity will ensured.
\
\AS your first assignment I'd like you to investigate a farm in
\the northern shires. There's been reports of some strange
\noises. Send a couple of your officers and help yourself to
\the armoury. You'll find us  better equipped than your
\regional parishes."

You report to Detective Oakshott...
\
\
\"Clockwork snakes you say! Well that is quite unusual but
\these are unusual times we live in. Why the very establishment
\of our New Police in it's visible and less visible guises is
\proof of such uncertain times. Nevertheless, I waffle. The
\scrap of these machines will come in handy. We have great
\minds behind us Detective, great minds indeed."
